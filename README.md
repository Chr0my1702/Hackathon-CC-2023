# My Hackathon 2023 Project
 
Welcome to "Chemical Quest"! This game is for those who want to experience the thrill of working with elements and compounds. The game has 8 levels, each with lots of tasks to complete. The main NPC, Yohan, is a villager who hires you to complete chemical tasks for him. As you progress through the levels, you will encounter new elements and compounds that you must use to complete the tasks. The game also features a merchant where you can buy necessary items to help you along the way. You will learn about acids, bases, salts, and many more. The apparatuses used within the game are designed to help GCSE level students understand required practicals within the game, making it a fun way to learn about elements. Get ready to embark on a chemical adventure and become a master of the elements!

And be prepared for the unexpected! Yohan sometimes requests that you go off the beaten path and acquire certain compounds through less conventional means, such as stealing from other villagers. These compounds can be used to create greater products and complete more difficult tasks. So, tread carefully and use your cunning and knowledge of chemical properties to complete these risky missions. With the right skills and a bit of luck, you'll come out on top and become a true master of the elements.

I used Ursina, a game engine for Python, to create my game and although it was a challenging experience, it helped me to develop my problem-solving skills and learn more about game development concepts. However, I advise that it's not recommended for production-level games due to Python's limitations, and there are better-suited game engines and programming languages that can make the development process more efficient and less time-consuming.

Ursina's collision and onclick system was too slow for my game's needs, so I had to create my own from scratch, which proved to be more efficient in the end.



## Installation:
To install this game, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: ```git clone https://github.com/Chr0my1702/Hackathon-CC-2023```

CD into Hackathon-CC-2023 folder

Install the required packages: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

```WARNING: Some parts of the interactions of NPC's and objects may not work due to me not including the physics system I added to Ursina. Dont be shocked when things fall through the map.```

To run the project, simply execute the main.py file using the following command: `python main.py`

The code should now be running and you should be able to interact with the game.

Note: If you get a PermissionError when trying to play the speech, make sure to run the code as an administrator or to specify a different directory where you have write permission.
